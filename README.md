# CapituloX
CapítuloX is an intelligent PDF-interaction platform built with LangChain and Streamlit and powered by OpenAI's language models. It enables users to upload one or multiple PDF documents — such as academic articles, reports, or technical manuals — and interact with the content through natural language questions.

Once PDFs are uploaded, the application automatically extracts and processes the textual content using document loaders and advanced chunking techniques. It then uses semantic embeddings and vector similarity search to retrieve the most relevant parts of the documents based on user queries. These contextual chunks are passed to an LLM (Large Language Model), which generates high-quality, context-aware answers tailored to the user's questions.

CapítuloX is designed to support deep reading and analysis workflows for students, educators, researchers, and professionals. With it, users can quickly get summaries, clarify complex topics, extract insights, and deeply understand the material — all without needing to manually search through the entire document.

Key features include:

📄 Support for multiple PDF uploads

🔍 Intelligent context extraction using text embeddings

🤖 Interactive Q&A with GPT-4o-mini

🧠 Custom prompts designed for academic-style comprehension

📚 Expandable section to preview the extracted content

🛡️ Local file processing for enhanced privacy and control

CapítuloX is ideal for transforming passive reading into an active, AI-powered exploration experience.
